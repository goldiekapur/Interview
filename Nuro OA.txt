//problem: count islands in a graph
//
// A graph is a collection of nodes that are connected to each other with
// edges. There are N nodes, numbered 1..N. and M edges. Each edge connects
// two different node numbers. Here is an example graph with N= 8, M=6:
//
// 1---2---3 6 8
// | | |
// 4---5 7
//
// The goal is to count the number of islands in the graph. An island is a
// graph of nodes that are connected only to themselves and not to any of the
// other nodes in the graph. The above example has three islands. As a node
// not connected to anything at all is regarded as it own island.

// Implement the function IslandCount() below. The values N and M are passed
// in, along with the array E which contains pairs of node numbers that are
// connected by edges. The above example has E equal to
//
// E = { 1,2,2,3, 1,4, 2, 5, 4,5, 6, 7}
//
// IslandCount() should return the number of islands in the graph.
